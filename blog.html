        <h1>1) What Is DOM And What Is The Purpose Of DOM?</h1>
        <p>DOM means Document Object Model (DOM), which is a programming interface for HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
            and
            Extensible
            markup language (XML) documents. It defines the logical connection of documents and the way by which a
            document is accessed
            and
            manipulated.

        <h2>Purpose of DOM</h2>
        <li>To create Dynamic Web Page.</li>
        <li>Main purpose of DOM is to respond to the user actions (like clicks, inputs, or scrolls).</li>
        <li>To update content</li>
        </p>
        <h1>2) How Will You Select HTML Elements Using DOM? Name The DOM Methods. </h1>
        <p>I select HTML Elements using Class Name, Id, or Tag Name.
        <h2>Name of The DOM Methods</h2>
        <li>getElementByID()</li>
        <li>getElementsByClassName()</li>
        <li>getElementsByTagName()</li>
        <li>querySelector()</li>
        <li>querySelectorAll()</li>
        </p>
        <h1>3) What Is Event Bubble?</h1>
        <p>Event bubbling is a process that starts with the element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to the
            containing elements in the hierarchy. In event bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the
            innermost element and then propagated to outer elements.</p>
        <h1>4) What Is A Callback Function And Why Will You Use It?</h1>
        <p>A callback function in javascript is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished
            its execution.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use callback functions to make sure that a function is only going to get executed after a specific task
            is completed and not before its completion.
        </p>
